Multinational & Trends(M&T) is a website that sells and displays fashionable clothes for men. On this website, users can see trending clothes, upcoming clothes that are to be released by M&T, M&T’s location, and M&T’s about which includes an introduction and history. Users can also subscribe to the website to get the latest men’s clothing news. This is a project where me and my human-computer interaction lab partner design and code a website called M&T
